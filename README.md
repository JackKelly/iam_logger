This code will log power data from multiple Current Cost Individual Appliance Monitors (IAMs) using one
or more Current Cost EnvirR base units.

Please note that I am no longer actively developing or using this code because I am now using EDF IAMs instead of 
CC IAMS and I am using my own base unit instead of EnviR(s).
Please see my blog post on 
["Summary of my energy monitoring code"](http://jack-kelly.com/summary_of_my_energy_monitoring_code) for more details.
